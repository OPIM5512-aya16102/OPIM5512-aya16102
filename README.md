# Hi, I'm Ahmed 👋  

I'm an M.S. Data Science student at the **University of Connecticut** with a background in **Chemistry** and professional experience as a **Process Engineer**. My engineering work sparked my interest in using data to improve processes, identify inefficiencies, and drive informed decisions.

I'm passionate about data analysis, predictive modeling, and applying machine learning to solve real-world business problems. This GitHub showcases my projects, experiments, and continued learning in data science.

Thanks for stopping by!
